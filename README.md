# forallx R<sup>3</sup>
## Description

This is a complete and open textbook for formal logic. Formal logic, as a field, is a subdiscipline within Philosophy which studies the relationship between assumptions
(premises) and conclusions. It is ‘formal’ in the sense that it concerns the form
or shape of the assumptions/conclusions on an abstract level so the same logical structure can be used in many different unrelated contexts with the same
level of certainty. This textbook covers the key concepts such as entailment, validity, symbolization, and proofs, as well as some more advanced topics like Modal Logic. 
Using a Fitch-style proof system, the formal languages covered are Propositional Logic, Quantified Logic, and Modal Logics. 

There are many [other versions/editions of forallx](https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic/wiki/Other-Logic-Textbooks) out there, this one is unique in that:

1. It provides biographies for various logicians and philosophers important to the history and development of formal logic.
2. It reimagines the modal logic system to be both sound and complete. 
3. It redefines the inference rule Dilemma in order to retain the spirit while being more practically useful.
4. It includes an additional equivalency rule (TAUT) which simplifies many proofs.
5. It returns to P.D. Magnus' original Disjunction Elimination, Negation Introduction, and Negation Elimination inference rules.

There are 10 modules (sections or parts) covering a different aspect of logic. These are: 

1. Arguments and Logic
2. Symbolization
3. Truth Tables
4. Natural Deduction I
5. Natural Deduction II
6. Quantified Logic
7. Validity in QL
8. Natural Deduction in QL I
9. Natural Deduction in QL II
10. Modal Logic


This work is under **perpetual** development and may change with time. As it sits now, it is a fully functional textbook which is being used at Pierce College and other colleges and universities around the globe. 

## Notes for Instructors

This book was designed for a quarter-long (10
weeks) introduction to formal logic. In my classes, I (Davis A. Smith) cover
all modules, spending 1 week per module. The CC BY license gives you the
right to download and distribute the book yourself. In order to ensure that all
your students have the same version of the book throughout the term you’re
using it, you should upload the PDF you decide to use to your LMS rather than
merely give your students a link to the source. You are also free to have the
PDFs printed by your bookstore.

The syntax and proof systems are supported by Graham Leach-Krouse’s
free, online logic teaching software application [Carnap.io](carnap.io). I recommend that
this be included in your course as a course companion. It allows for submission
and automated marking of exercises such as symbolization, truth tables, and
natural deduction proofs.

## About the Author

Davis Smith earned his Master’s Degree in Philosophy from Arizona State University and is an adjunct Philosophy professor at three colleges, Pierce College, Bellevue College, and Olympic College, all in Washington, USA. 
He specializes in teaching introductory level courses. One of his goals in teaching is to make Philosophy
accessible to all people. The cost and quality of textbooks are under-discussed obstacles to accessibility which Mr. Smith seeks to remove. His other textbooks are: 

- [ ] [Questions We Have](https://github.com/ProfDavisSmith/QuestionsWeHave#readme) An Introduction to Philosophy
- [ ] [Who Should I Be? What Should I Do?](https://github.com/ProfDavisSmith/WSIBWSID#readme) An Introduction to Ethics 

Outside of his OER textbooks, his current projects relate to the plausibility of libertarian free will, the philosophy of rhyme, and the philosophy of profanity.
